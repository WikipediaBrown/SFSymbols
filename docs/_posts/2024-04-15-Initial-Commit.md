This is the first blog post about **SFSymbols**. SFSymbols is a tiny ***Swift*** package that provides extensions to `String` and `UIImage` to make using **SFSymbols** easy peasy. The extensions and the accompanying `Enum` are all generated using the python scripts included in this package along with a list of all of the `SFSymbols` names. The package is currently updated to support SFSymbols 5.2.
